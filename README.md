# Core Kuali Days 2016

# Prerequisites

- [git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [node v6](https://nodejs.org/en/) (Node 4 might work, but best to upgrade to
  the latest LTS version)
- `npm` (comes bundled with node) or `yarn`
- Chrome is preferred (for debugging), but not required
- Internet Access. If the Internet becomes unusable, we'll have a plan b.
- Terminal

# Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/KualiCo/cor-kuali-days.git
cd cor-kuali-days
npm install # Or yarn if you prefer
npm run watch # Or in two separate tabs: npm run watch:server and npm run watch:client
```
